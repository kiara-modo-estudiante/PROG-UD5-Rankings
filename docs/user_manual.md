## Running the Program

To run the program whose executable file is `App.java`, follow these steps:

### Compile the File

If the `App.java` file is not compiled, you need to compile it first. Open the integrated terminal in Visual Studio Code and execute the following command:

```bash
javac App.java
```

This will generate a `App.class` file, which is the bytecode that the JVM (Java Virtual Machine) can execute.

### Run the Program

Once compiled, you can run the program with the following command:

```bash
java App
```

This will start the application and open the user interface (UI).

### Exit the Program

To close the application, look for the "Exit" button in the user interface and click it. This will safely stop the program's execution.

## Notes

- Data is not saved between sessions.
- Make sure to enter valid values in the forms to avoid errors.
- Mandatory fields must be completed for actions to be processed correctly.
- In case of an error, a message will indicate the specific issue.
