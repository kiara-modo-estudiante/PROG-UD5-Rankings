# Unit 5 - Practice: RANKINGS

The application is a rating system for items (in this case, scuba diving spots ü§ø) using scores from 1 to 5. It includes CRUD functionalities (Create, Read, Update, and Delete) that allow easy management of the rated items.

Since the client has no technical knowledge and prefers to avoid using the console, the interface has been developed using Java Swing, offering a simple and intuitive graphical experience. ‚≠êÔ∏è

üóíÔ∏è Note: Data is not saved between executions, so each time the application starts, it begins with an empty list.

## Project Objectives

- Implement a management system for items with CRUD functionalities.
- Design a user-friendly graphical interface using Java Swing.
- Validate user inputs to ensure data integrity.
- Provide a smooth and accessible user experience.

## User Manual

The complete user manual is available in the [`docs`](./docs) folder. You can consult it in the file [user_manual.md](./docs/user_manual.md) for detailed instructions on how to use the application.
